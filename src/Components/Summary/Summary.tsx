      Naruto, an anime set in a ninja universe that sees us follow a seemingly
      pathetic yet hilarious ninja aptly named Naruto, premiered on October 3,
      2005 on TV Tokyo. It was slammed with international success, and soon
      became one of the top animes/mangas ever. It was picked up by Cartoon
      Network in 2005, where the network began airing the show on Toonami adding
      to its ever-growing popularity. The show featured intense hand-to-hand
      combat action, over the top comedy, and introduced the world to timeless
      characters like Naruto, Sasuke, and the hilariously gross Jiraiya Sensei.
      Whether the show has a special place in your heart or not, it’s hard to
      deny its global popularity or the insufferable love that fans have for the
      show. This popularity only seems to grow as time goes by. With 220
      episodes in the original and 500 in the continuation, Naruto Shippuden,
      it’s almost impossible to remember every stunning moment or witness every
      hilarious story-line across the show’s extensive timeline. Who could
      forget that time Rock Lee fought while out of it? Or when Kakashi was bit
      by the love-bug? Hopefully you’re not kicking yourself for missing out on
      those unforgettable moments, but just in case you are, here's 20 hidden
      plot lines you might’ve missed in Naruto.
